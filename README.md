# welcome
 In this project  I have made authetication via email and login logout page using Django.
 Email verification is a very essential part which has to be done to identify fake email in the web application while making a new account
 In this project user can make only one account with his email id.
 On registering in this page user will be redirected to check your mail for verification page.
 after opening mail a link will be provided to the user to verify him.on verification he will be redirected to the login page.
 After giving verified username and password user can access his page.
 I have also integrated payment gateway using razorpay for online payment.
